# Tech Task: Engineer
Hey! firstly thanks for taking the time to complete the technical task.  It really does help us gauge abilities, experience and approaches.

We have tried to keep the technical task simple so that you can focus on showcasing your best engineering practices.

## Beer Browser
We love beer! especially punk beer, your task is to create a simple website app that allows beer enthusiasts to browse through punk beer so they can discover new ones.

### Requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like, we do need the following as a bare minimum:

* The page **must** render isomorphically / universally.
* User stories below are satisfied.
* A `README.md` should state the exact commands for the app to run.
* Ensure the [`FOLLOWUP.md`](https://github.com/craftship/tech-task/blob/master/FOLLOWUP.md) questions are answered.
* Feel free to use whatever frameworks / libraries / packages you like.
* Have fun with it :D

### API
In order to create the beer browser we need some data, thankfully there is a great api that requires no authentication.  The API we are going to use is the [punk api](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2).

#### Endpoints
Beers: **https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers**

### UX

### Design

Feel free to implement your own design based on the UX supplied above.

For those who wish to showcase the ability to follow designs please ensure we have given you access to our [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io) account so you can get the relevant assets, spacing and styles.

To give you a flavour of the pre-built design, see the following:

### User Stories
```
As a beer enthusiast
I see an initial beer
So that I can start discovering more beer
```

```
As a beer enthusiast
I can navigate right or left
So that I can browse beers
```

```
As a beer enthusiast
I can not navigate left when on the first beer
So that I know I am at the start of the beers
```

```
As a beer enthusiast
I can not navigate right when on the last beer
So that I know I am at the end of the beers
```


### Submission Guide
1. Ensure [`FOLLOWUP.md`](https://github.com/craftship/tech-task/blob/master/FOLLOWUP.md) has been filled in and included in your project
1. Zip your coding challenge without installable dependencies such as `node_modules`
2. Name your zip file as `beer-browser.firstname.lastname.zip` (e.g. `beer-browser.john.doe.zip`)
3. E-mail your submission to `submissions@craftship.io`
